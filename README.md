# coinOfWants
A program for determining whether there is a coincidence of wants between people. Useful for organising.

Imagine you (Person A) are planning a party. You want Persons B through F to join you, but each of those people may have different requirements for attendance. For example, Person E may only want to come if Person B is attending, and Person B will only attend with Person F. Nobody wants to communicate these things to each other, as it could be hurtful. The natural solution, then, is to create a web-app to solve the problem. 

NOTE - This project is now my SQA Advanced Higher Computing Science project and as such I cannot update changes on Github
